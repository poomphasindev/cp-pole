## 🌐 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Prepare Repository

```bash
# Initialize git (if not already done)
git init
git remote add origin <your-github-repo-url>

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Initial deployment ready"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Deploy on Streamlit Cloud

1. Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
2. Sign in with your GitHub account
3. Click "New app"
4. Configure the app:
   - **Repository**: Select your repository
   - **Branch**: `main`
   - **Main file path**: `maincai.py`
   - **App URL**: Choose a custom URL (optional)
5. Click "Deploy"

### Step 3: Verify Deployment

- [ ] App loads without errors
- [ ] Model loads successfully
- [ ] File upload works
- [ ] Image classification works
- [ ] Excel export works
- [ ] UI displays correctly

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. Model Loading Errors

- **Issue**: Model file not found
- **Solution**: Ensure `model/keras_model.h5` is in the repository

#### 2. Dependency Conflicts

- **Issue**: Package version conflicts
- **Solution**: Check `requirements.txt` for compatible versions

#### 3. Python 3.13 Compatibility Issues

- **Issue**: TensorFlow/NumPy compatibility with Python 3.13
- **Solution**: Updated to TensorFlow >= 2.15.0 and NumPy >= 1.24.0
- **Alternative**: Use `requirements_alt.txt` if issues persist

#### 3. Memory Issues

- **Issue**: App crashes due to memory limits
- **Solution**: Model is already cached with `@st.cache_resource`

#### 4. File Upload Issues

- **Issue**: Files not uploading
- **Solution**: Check file size limits and supported formats
